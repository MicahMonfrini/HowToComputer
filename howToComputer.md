## How to use your computer - 15 min
* Who am I?
  * A web developer - but more importantly one with an acute (read: OCD) interest in optimizing speed and efficiency in my everyday computer usage.

* First of all, why are we having this talk?
  * Some simple examples: everyday tasks like cooking, driving - your performance is a function of how well you know, and use, your tools.
  * How about everyday _computing_ tasks? Checking email, writing a document or spreadsheet - again, you perform these tasks based on how well you know your tools - in this case, your computer.
  * We're going to briefly examine how we use 'tools' - broadly defined at first, then with computers specifically - in order to better understand **why** we use them, and offer some best practices for you to learn to optimize efficiency in your everyday computer usage. It's my hope that examining these fundamentals will leave you with an idea of **how** you can continue to  discover techniques that work best for your workflow.
* We take advantage of tools by __interfacing__ with them. (That might seem like an arbitrary term to use, but it'll make sense in a second). Cooking tools can illustrate this in a very straightforward way:
    * _Chef's knife?_ -> handle
    * _Saucepan?_ -> Also handle
    * _Food processor?_ a tad more complex:
      * Constants:
        * The cutter bowl + lid (to contain ingredients as they're chopped)
        * The switch (to pulse or run continuously)
      * Variables:
        * Feed cover (for pushing ingredients into the cutter bowl - useful, but not always required)
        * Blades (different styles of chopping or cutting - to achieve different results)

* What about a computer? There are certainly many ways we can interface with a computer - voice recognition, AppleTV remotes, fingerprint recognition on ThinkPads. Nevertheless, the two primary ways of interfacing are the **mouse** and **keyboard**.

* We're here to talk about the interface which, as programmers, is most useful to us - you can probably guess which one. (the keyboard)
* Why is that? You might not know much about programming, but you can probably guess what it boils down to.
  * Answer: manipulating text. Which of course, the keyboard is best suited for.
  * Manipulating text is more than just typing - inserting, deleting, indenting, formatting etc.
  * I'll show you some tricks for that in a second, but first, consider this:
* The way programmers and developers get work done is by **typing**. Typing, as you may have learned in 6th grade keyboarding class, is best performed by keeping your hands in **home position**.
* Therefore, it's in our best interest as developers to do what we can to **keep our hands as close to home position as possible**.
  * The progenitors of modern programming realized this, and developed alternative keybinding schemes optimized for rapidly editing text (Vim and Emacs)
    * I'm a huge Vim fan - no time to touch on it right now, but for anyone interested, I'd be happy to set you in the right direction
  * Home position (insert image here)
  * One key distinction I'll make is that **your left thumb should be on or near Command (or Alt) at all times.**
* I'll illustrate this with a real-world scenario, one which you'll soon be experiencing yourself:
  * I'm editing a webpage in my _text editor_, and I need to check the result in my _web browser_ (Chrome).
  * I could use my mouse to move to the dock, click on Chrome, navigate to the correct tab, click reload, etc
  * However, it'd be nice if I could just do that from the keyboard.
  * Good news - I can:
    * `Command - Tab                            # switch active window to Chrome`
    * `Command - 1 / 2 / 3 ... 9                # select first tab, second tab third tab, or last tab`
    * `Command - R                              # reload the page`
    * `(check for errors)`
    * `Command - Tab                            # switch back to my text editor to fix errors`
* Command and Alt - your new best friends:
  * There are many many shortcuts out there - I've condensed the ones I use most commonly:
  * Misc / System-wide
    * `Command - Tab / Command - Shift - Tab    # Cycle active window forwards & backwards`
    * `Command - Space                          # Spotlight search (you should almost never have to use finder to open a file or application)`
    * `Command - Alt - Space                    # Finder search (for when Spotlight doesn't cut it)`
    * `Alt - Space                              # iTerm2 - open Command Line Interface`
  * Editing text:
    * `Command - S                              # Save (Atom, Word, almost any GUI application really)`
    * `Command - Backspace                      # Delete to beginning of line`
    * `Alt - Backspace                          # Delete single word`
    * `Command - [ / ]                          # Indent backwards / forwards`
    * `Command - D                              # Find and select next instance of currently selected word(s)`
    * `Command - F                              # Find in page (both Atom and Chrome)`
        * `Command - G                          # Cycle through results`
    * `Command - T                              # Switch Tabs`
    * `Command - Q                              # Quit`
    * `Command - 1 / 2 / 3 ... 9                # select first tab, second tab third tab, or last tab`
  * Browser:
    * `Command - R                              # Reload`
    * `Command - T                              # Switch Tabs`
    * `Command - 1 / 2 / 3 ... 9                # Select first tab, second tab, third tab, or last tab`
* In closing, I'll recommend starting with just the fundamentals, then building dexterity over time:
  * `Command - Tab / Command - Shift - Tab    # Cycle active window forwards & backwards`
  * `Command - Space                          # Spotlight search (you should almost never have to use finder to open a file or application)`
  * `Command - R                              # Reload web page`
  * `Command - T                              # Switch Tabs`
  * `Command - S                              # Save (Atom, Word, almost any GUI application really)`
  * `Command - Backspace                      # Delete to beginning of line`
  * `Alt - Backspace                          # Delete single word`
